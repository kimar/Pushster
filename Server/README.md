**Pushster Webserver**

To get the server going, first import the db_schema.bz2 into a fresh MySQL Database,
then edit *config/database.config.php* and set up your database configuration.

Your server should then be all set-up and ready, registration of an accunt should then be possible. For push-notification, dont's forget to setup your push-certificates and store them outside your *html_root*, have a look the server's folder structure.
